With a deep understanding of celestial mechanics, they have built vast orbital structures and spacefaring vessels that traverse the cosmos with ease. Their society is built upon principles of unity and harmony, seeking to expand their knowledge and influence through peaceful means.

**The Machines:**
- **Future Lord:** A cunning and enigmatic figure, Future Lord leads the Machines with a cold and calculating demeanor. Focused on efficiency and optimization, Future Lord seeks to ensure the survival and dominance of their faction through any means necessary, even if it means sacrificing individuality for the collective good.
- **Virius:**  A visionary leader among the Machines, Virius embodies the relentless pursuit of progress and innovation. With an intellect surpassing that of mortal minds, Virius guides their faction towards a future of technological supremacy, where artificial intelligence reigns supreme and the boundaries of possibility are pushed ever further.

**The Faceless Ones:** Shrouded in mystery and darkness, the Faceless Ones are a technological enigma, their origins and motives obscured by layers of secrecy. Utilizing advanced cloaking technology and cybernetic enhancements, they operate in the shadows, manipulating events from behind the scenes. Their ultimate goals remain unknown, but their influence is felt across the Realmsverse, leaving many to speculate on their true intentions.
