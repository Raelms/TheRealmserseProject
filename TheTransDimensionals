The Faceless Ones, originating from the now-destroyed Dimension 66, haunt the Frontier Zone of the Realmsverse as ominous entities cloaked in black and green robes. Beneath their mysterious garb lies a formless void, concealed by metal masks that symbolize their identity. Removing these masks unleashes a fatal retaliation, enforcing the secrecy of their true nature. As a hive mind, they wield super advanced technology, engaging in a relentless feud with the precursors, the original beings of the Realmsverse, whom they decimated with their superior weaponry.

The Prophets/Oracles, emissaries from the lost Dimension 24, manifest as ethereal beings with humanoid forms suspended above the ground. Their azure visage and eye slits exude an aura of mysticism as they manipulate followers to denounce the Creator and fulfill their prophecies. Despite their enigmatic foresight, their downfall came with the Creator Prophecy, leading to their demise in the cataclysmic Great War of Prophecy, orchestrated by the very forces they sought to control.

The Hexpods, invaders from Dimension 33, epitomize chaos and destruction as purple-hued insectoids with mechanized countenances. With six legs and a penchant for war, they obliterated Dimensions 66 and 24, perpetuating conflict with both the Supreme Beings and the Realmsverse. Their insatiable thirst for conquest spans universes, leaving devastation in their wake.

The Supreme Beings, denizens of Dimension 27, stand as formidable adversaries with alabaster bodies adorned with ebony markings and pharaoh-like headgear. Inadvertently creating their own demise, they find themselves embroiled in a relentless war against the Creator and the Hexpods. In their society, females reign supreme, while males serve as drones and warriors, contributing to their complex hierarchy and perpetual struggle for dominance.
