In a tragic turn of events, humans, blinded by their own hubris, unleashed the cataclysmic Great Earth War, transforming their once-thriving planet into a desolate wasteland. As the dust settled on their self-inflicted devastation, they begrudgingly accepted their folly, but redemption eluded their grasp. Earth became a haven for pirate factions, who thrived amidst the ruins, forging a new way of life in the barren expanse.

Faced with the irreversible consequences of their actions, humans embarked on divergent paths to survival. The world's military, disillusioned by the failings of governance and research, abandoned Earth for the red plains of Mars, forming the formidable Militaria Order. With a fervent desire to assert dominance over the realmsverse, they brandish weapons as symbols of power and seek to subjugate all alien races under their rule.

Meanwhile, researchers and civilians sought refuge on the abandoned planet Utopia, where abundance of resources beckoned them to rebuild society under the banner of the Utopian Sect. Rejecting the militaristic ethos of their counterparts, they champion peace and cooperation with the diverse races of the realmsverse, recognizing the folly of aggression in a universe teeming with immortal and non-human entities.

As tensions escalate between the Militaria Order and the Utopian Sect, divergent ideologies clash over the fate of the 22nd Dimension. While the former advocates for conquest and eradication of alien races, the latter pursues diplomacy and coexistence, echoing the sentiments of many immortal beings who prefer humanity to withdraw from their realm.

Diverging further, both factions adopt distinct economic systems, with the Militaria Order trading in the macabre currency of volume of blood (VOB) and the Utopian Sect embracing the universal dollar (TUD) as a symbol of unity and commerce. Amidst the cosmic turmoil, the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, as they navigate a world rife with conflict, ambition, and the pursuit of redemption.
